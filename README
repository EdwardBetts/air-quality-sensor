air-quality-sensor - user space driver for USB Air Quality Sensor CO-20

The CO-20 is an easy to install sensor for monitoring air quality. This driver
prints a list with all connected sensors and their current values to the
commandline. Compatible sensors and further information has been documented on
http://wiki.micasaverde.com/index.php/CO2_Sensor.

The air quality is displayed on the hardware token by three indicator lamps
with the colours green (= good), yellow (= average) and red (= bad), the same
colors are also printed by this tool.
